    <h1>About This Site</h1>

    <p>
      This site exists to answer one blunt question, daily: did the United States
      initiate or significantly escalate armed conflict today? Not rhetorically.
      Not philosophically. Just: did it happen, yes or no, based on today's news.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was inspired by the elegant simplicity of
      <a href="https://isitchristmas.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isitchristmas.com</a>
      — which, for the record, is also usually No. The difference is that Christmas
      comes once a year and is generally considered a good thing.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p>
      Every day at noon UTC, a GitHub Action runs a script that fetches top
      military and geopolitical headlines from a news API, then sends them to
      the <a href="https://www.anthropic.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claude API</a>
      (claude-sonnet-4-6) with a prompt asking it to make a determination. The
      result — status, tagline, and supporting headlines — is written to a
      <code>status.json</code> file in the repo, which triggers an automatic
      redeploy. What you see on the homepage is whatever that file says.
    </p>

    <h2>Status definitions</h2>

    <div class="status-legend">
      <div class="legend-item">
        <span class="legend-dot no"></span>
        <span><strong>No.</strong> — No new armed conflict initiated or significantly escalated today.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="legend-item">
        <span class="legend-dot unclear"></span>
        <span><strong>Unclear.</strong> — Something happened that may or may not qualify, depending on how you define "war."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="legend-item">
        <span class="legend-dot yes"></span>
        <span><strong>Yes.</strong> — Yeah.</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>What counts</h2>

    <p>
      For the purposes of this site, "armed conflict" includes: airstrikes,
      military invasions, significant new troop deployments into active conflict
      zones, or weapons transfers that directly and immediately enable ongoing
      combat operations. It does <em>not</em> include: ongoing operations that
      were already underway with no new escalation, sanctions, diplomatic threats,
      military posturing without action, or strongly worded press releases.
    </p>

    <h2>Important caveats</h2>

    <p>
      This site is a joke. A serious joke, but a joke. The determination is made
      by an AI reading headlines — not by lawyers, historians, or anyone with
      a security clearance. "War" is legally and politically contested when
      you're the United States. The U.S. has been in varying states of armed
      engagement continuously for most of the past several decades, which is
      itself the whole point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>Unclear</strong> status exists precisely because the U.S.
      government has historically gone to great lengths to avoid calling things
      what they are. If lawyers are arguing about it, we'll say so.
    </p>

    <h2>Source code</h2>

    <p>
      This site is fully open source. The code, the automation pipeline, and
      the prompt are all visible on
      <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.
      Pull requests for better taglines welcome.
